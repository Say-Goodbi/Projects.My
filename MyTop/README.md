**MyTop** is a command-line application inspired by the Linux `top` command. It provides a real-time overview of the systemâ€™s resource usage, including running processes, CPU, memory usage, and more. This tool allows you to monitor system performance and identify resource-intensive processes.

## Features

- List running processes with detailed information like PID, CPU usage, memory usage, and more.
- Update in real-time to reflect system changes.
